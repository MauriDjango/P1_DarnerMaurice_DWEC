# Tabletop Game Community Application

#### Application Proposal
## Description

Connecting an army of loyal fans, hobbyists, artists, vendors, and newcomers all in one App. Whilst not having to manage
multiple communities and platforms at once the app, adeptly named **Adeptus Nexus**,  aims to be the one-stop-shop for 
all things Warhammer 40k. Providing a marketplace for players to sell and trade their miniatures, painters and craftsman
to offer their services, and a forum for players to discuss tactics, lore, and share their latest creations.

## Target Audience

The focus of this app is on the everyday player and hobbyist. Whilst still providing a space for professional stores
and vendors. Vendors already have their own dedicated space to sell their products and services which is something the 
players are currently lacking, at least in a consolidated and easy to manage fashion. Players see themselves having to
navigate several platforms and communities to find the product or information  that they are looking for and a majority
of the time these platform are not solely dedicated to the world of Warhammer 40k and thus can be found lacking in detail
or specifics needed to provide players with everything they need.

## Market Analysis

The market for Warhammer 40k is a niche market, but it is a market that is growing and has an incredibly loyal and dedicated 
player and fan base. With the release of the 10th edition and various celebrities such as Henry Cavill, Trey Parker, and
Ed Sheeran just to name a few, being open about their love for the game, the market is only going to continue to grow. - 
[SpikeyBits Article](https://spikeybits.com/warhammer-40k/celebrities/). However, the issue for most current players and 
others who would like to join in on the fun is the price of new models as well as paints and other hobby supplies. So at
any point where a player wants to add to or modify their army of miniatures they are looking at a hefty price tag. This
leads to many players looking for second hand models or trading with other players to get what they need. This is where 
the app comes in, providing a platform for players to sell and trade their models and other hobby supplies.

### Currently Available Platforms
As of now players look to platforms such as Facebook Marketplace, Wallapop, Ebay, and even self created Whatsapp groups to
find what they are looking for. However, these platforms are not solely dedicated to Warhammer 40k and thus can be found 
lacking in details or information that players need to make an informed decisions or for new players to get a foot into 
the doorway of the world of Warhammer 40k and make their first purchase.

### What the App Provides
As you can imagine this leaves a void between official stores and online marketplaces where the Warhammer community is 
not being  catered to. This is where Adeptus Nexus comes in, a place where all things Warhammer can be found. A place 
where players can find opportunities to mold their part of the universe as they see fit. Where they can research and learn 
about where their Warhammer journey is heading. And where they can be kept up to date on community evens and tournaments.

### Key Features

#### The Forge
A marketplace for players to sell and trade their miniatures, paints,books, and other hobby supplies. As well a physical materials
players can also offer up their services as painters, terrain builders, and even offering spaces to host battles and wars.

#### The Librarius
A space for all things lore. A principle factor that gives Warhammer the love that it has is the universe and it's lore. 
What does it matter what faction your army belongs to or what chapter of space marines you are playing if you are not invested 
in their history and the struggles they have faced against their foes and allies alike. containing over 600 books in Warhammer 
40k alone, the lore is vast and ever expanding. The Codex will provide a space for players to discuss, share, and learn
about the universe they are playing in.

#### The Strategium
Being so many facets to the world of Warhammer from the video games, to the artistry, to the books, a great portion of it 
is dedicated to actually playing the table game. The games can last for hours, can take up several tables filled with 
armies of miniatures, and can be held in venues as small as a basement, to the backroom of a store, to in large halls 
holding tournaments and hundreds of players from across the continent. With these battles comes a set o recognised rules 
that are updated every 9 months. 
With so many tournaments and events and rule changes it can be somewhat cumbersome to keep up with everything. The Strategium
will a provide a space for players to stay up to date on the latest rules, tactics, and events. As well as a space for players
to post events and tournaments that they are hosting or attending.

#### The Front line
A center for news of all things Warhammer. From the latest releases, to the latest lore. The Front line will help players
stay up to speed on everything that is happening in the Warhammer universe.

#### The Citadel
Players can congregate onto this forum and discuss anything and everything Warhammer. Make connections, allies, hopefully 
not enemies, share their latest creations, seek guidance on their latest project, and even find a group to play with.
