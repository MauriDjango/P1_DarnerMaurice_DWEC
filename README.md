## Project Description

In this project, I initiated the planning of a web application, laying a solid foundation for the final project of the course. The focus was on defining the application idea, researching relevant technologies and techniques, and creating a preliminary design and structure plan. Additionally, I conducted a market analysis to identify similar applications and assess how my application can differentiate itself and provide new value. This preliminary work serves as the groundwork for the subsequent development and implementation phases.

### Objective

The main objective of this project was to create an initial proposal for the web application that will be developed as the final project of the course. This proposal is supported by technical research that justifies decisions regarding client/server execution models, web programming languages, and browser behavior, among other aspects. Furthermore, I performed a market analysis to understand the existing competition, planned the architecture and key functionalities of the application, and prepared an initial prototype or wireframe in collaboration with the design course.

### Estimated Duration

The estimated duration for this project was **2 weeks**.

### Evaluation Criteria

The project was evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Differentiation of client and server execution models.
- Identification of browser execution capabilities and mechanisms.
- Characterization of primary languages related to web client programming.
- Understanding the peculiarities of scripting programming, its advantages, and disadvantages compared to traditional programming.
- Verification of integration mechanisms between markup languages and web client programming languages.
- Evaluation of programming tools for web clients.

## Activities

1. **Application Idea**: Clearly and concisely described the web application idea and its purpose.
2. **Target Audience**: Defined the target audience for the application, explaining its relevance and benefits.
3. **Market Analysis**: Researched and analyzed similar applications in the market to identify common features and differentiation opportunities.
4. **Key Functionalities**: Listed the main functionalities that the application will offer, such as authentication systems and user management.
5. **Execution Models**: Researched and compared client and server execution models, highlighting differences and use cases.
6. **Web Programming Languages**: Analyzed the most commonly used programming languages for web development, explaining their advantages and disadvantages.
7. **Technologies to Use**: Selected appropriate technologies (programming languages, frameworks, development tools) for application development and justified these choices based on the research.
8. **Browser Compatibility**: Conducted a study on how different browsers handle JavaScript and other languages used in web development, identifying compatibility issues and solutions.
